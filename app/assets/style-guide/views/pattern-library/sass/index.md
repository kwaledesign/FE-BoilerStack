Archetype
=========

>Archetype (n): 1. A symbol, pattern, or prototype upon which others are copied, patterned, or emulated; 2. A flexible, object oriented, Sass architecture for mobile-first, responsive builds with built in live style guide.

Archetype is a front-end toolkit designed with the principles of [OOCSS](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss) and [SMACSS](http://smacss.com) for building responsive, mobile-first front-ends using a specific [coding standardard](https://github.com/Archetype-CSS/Archetype/blob/dev/style-guide/docs/README.md). Archetype integrates [Hologram](https://github.com/trulia/hologram) to automatically generate and update a project specific style guide and/or pattern library to facilitate style-guide-driven development, as well as encourage frequent testing and a performant front-end.

A specific implimentation of several open source projects.

  1. Naming convention based on bem and [OOCSS](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss) 
  2. Architecture based on [SMACSS](http://smacss.com) 
  2. Modular and distributed style sheet architecture built on bower, inspired by [SUIT](https://github.com/suitcss/suit)
  3. Layout is treated as an enhancement
  4. Integrated Style Guide using [Hologram](https://github.com/trulia/hologram)
  5. Test driven
  6. Built with [Grunt](http://bower.io)
