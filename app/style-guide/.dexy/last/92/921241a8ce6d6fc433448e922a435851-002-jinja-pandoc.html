<h1 id="settings">Settings</h1>
<p>The <code>_settings.scss</code> partial contains both <a href="https://github.com/chriseppstein/compass">Compass</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kwaledesign/Archetype">Archetype</a> settings that are applied project wide. Items such as vertical-rhythm and legacy browser support as well as Archetype's implementation of <a href="">Normalize</a> are all controlled here.</p>
