<ul>
<li>The absence of media queries is the first media query.</li>
<li>Develop for <em>Mobile First</em> <a href="/#works-cited">[14]</a> as a baseline level of support for small screens and slow connections</li>
<li>emphasize content over navigationand to maintain clear and focused User Experience goals.</li>
<li>Use modernizrmedia queriesand conditional loading to provide an enhanced experience for more capable devices.</li>
<li>Use browser prefixes correctly and painlessly by abstracting into a preprocessor mixin.</li>
<li>Avoid separate styles for IE except where unavoidable.</li>
<li>Use Conditional classes <a href="/#works-cited">[24]</a> and not conditional stylesheets or CSS hacks.</li>
<li>Group IE Conditional styling with the code they alter to increase both readability and maintainability.</li>
<li>Normalize Don't Reset - A global reset is a convenient way of ensuring consistent styling cross browser but it is often overkill and it makes CSS harder to debug in developer tools. Source: <a href="http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/">Normalize.css</a></li>
<li>Don't be over-zealous when normalising - When normalising it is important to not add styles to elements that then need to be overridden in future modules. Tables and form elements are great examples of this. Source: <a href="http://smacss.com/book/drop-the-base">SMACSS on drop the base</a></li>

<h2 id="guidelines-for-handling-media-23">Guidelines for Handling Media <a href="/#works-cited">[23]</a></h2>
<p><strong>The Golden Rule</strong> - Which ever solution you implement to handle images and media within responsive buildsit WILL be depreciated so be sure that is easy to change.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Use SVG and icon fonts whenever possible and implement fallbacks when appropriate</li>
<li>Encourage content creators to upload highest quality source possible to facilitate appropriate adjustments server-side without significant degradation.</li>
<li>Implement automatic image resize and compression to provide necessary image assetsi.e. <a href="http://drupal.org/project/imagecache">Drupal Image Cache Module</a> or equivalent.</li>
<li>Whenever possible allow for images to be resized to any size with URL parametersi.e. <a href="http://www.cdnconnect.com/">CDN Connect</a>.</li>
<li>Responsive images markup function (b/c it will change!)</li>
<li>Plan for the art direction use-case.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill">Picturefill</a> raster graphics.</li>
<li>Scope images within media queries to avoid redundant downloads</li>
</ol>
